/**
 * URLConnection Network Handler.
 *
 * This class uses a {@link BranchExecutor} to schedule (through Android AsyncTasks) network
 * requests.
 *
 * As new requests are coming, the policy in this class is to schedule the new request, and then
 * cancel any pending request for the same type. Canceling pending requests is:
 *
 * - expensive - if the task is in the middle of network I/O, canceling can take time
 * - important - if we don't, we allow multiple requests of the same time, and this means
 *   we can't guarantee that the result callback is called in the correct order and this can
 *   cause UI issues.
 * - delicate in that we must ensure that it's not called on an UI thread.
 *
 * For this reason we do cancel running tasks but use the same {@link BranchExecutor} to schedule
 * the cancel operations. The cancel op. will free up a running thread for future requests.
 *
 * Each POST or GET request can trigger 2 (short-lived) thread requests.
 * The {@link BranchExecutor} pool size is set here to 6, which is just a maximum limit.
 * These threads are cached and only instantiated when needed.
 *
 * If we happen to need more than 6 threads at the same time, requests are enqueued by
 * {@link BranchExecutor} and will wait for currently running ops to finish, which would have
 * an impact on latency. But hopefully this should not happen too often, and some of these busy
 * threads will always be cancel requests that are executed much faster than network request.
